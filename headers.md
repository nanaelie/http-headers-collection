**HTTP headers** are essential components of HTTP requests and responses. They carry key metadata such as content type, security directives, cache control, origin policies, and more. Proper header configuration improves security, enhances browser compatibility, and protects user privacy.

This collection provides a concise overview of the most useful headers, including:

* their **recommended value**,
* their **effect on browser behavior or security**,
* and the **risks involved** if missing or misconfigured.
